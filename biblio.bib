	abstract = {Android is the most widely deployed end-user focused operating system. With its growing set of use cases encompassing communication, navigation, media consumption, entertainment, finance, health, and access to sensors, actuators, cameras, or microphones, its underlying security model needs to address a host of practical threats in a wide variety of scenarios while being useful to non-security experts. The model needs to strike a difficult balance between security, privacy, and usability for end users, assurances for app developers, and system performance under tight hardware constraints. While many of the underlying design principles have implicitly informed the overall system architecture, access control mechanisms, and mitigation techniques, the Android security model has previously not been formally published. This article aims to both document the abstract model and discuss its implications. Based on a definition of the threat model and Android ecosystem context in which it operates, we analyze how the different security measures in past and current Android implementations work together to mitigate these threats. There are some special cases in applying the security model, and we discuss such deliberate deviations from the abstract model.},

Hence, several mechanisms have been proposed to address this issue. However, to date, the impact of changes in the current permission system on both end users and software developers has not been studied, and no significant work has been done to determine whether adopting a finer-grained permission system would be feasible in practice.},

	abstract = {Android uses a permission-based security model to restrict applications from accessing private data and privileged resources. However, the permissions are assigned at the application level, so even untrusted third-party libraries, such as advertisement, once incorporated, can share the same privileges as the entire application, leading to over-privileged problems.We present AFrame, a developer friendly method to isolate untrusted third-party code from the host applications. The isolation achieved by AFrame covers not only the process/permission isolation, but also the display and input isolation. Our AFrame framework is implemented through a minimal change to the existing Android code base; our evaluation results demonstrate that it is effective in isolating the privileges of untrusted third-party code from applications with reasonable performance overhead.},
