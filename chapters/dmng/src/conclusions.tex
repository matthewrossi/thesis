\section{Conclusions}

The mitigation of security bugs and vulnerabilities that affect cloud
applications is an important topic. In this work, we presented an
approach to support the introduction of security policies to restrict
the file system resources available to an application. To facilitate
adoption, a central aspect in our proposal is the support to policy
generation. We provide an open source tool to generate and customize
least privilege policies leveraging the powerful, yet complex, ptrace
and eBPF kernel technologies.  Compared to virtualization technologies
such as VMs and containers, which are associated with coarse
granularity, we demonstrate that our proposal enables the introduction
of fine-grained, per-resource access rules. The experiments showcase
the capability of our approach to mitigate severe CVEs at the cost of
limited, often negligible, overhead.

While currently the protection is limited to the file system, the
isolation can be extended to other subsystems (e.g., the network).
This is a promising line of research we aim to explore in the future.
