\section{Experiments \label{sec:exp}}

To investigate the overhead introduced by our solution we implemented
it in WasmEdge and Wasmtime, two industrial state-of-the-art Wasm
runtimes. The evaluation has been performed in the following test
environment: an Ubuntu 22.04 LTS server powered by an AMD Ryzen 2950X
CPU with 16 cores, 128 GB RAM, and 2 TB SSD. %No kernel
%upgrade or modification was required, as eBPF is already available in
%the default OS image.
In order to assess the performance, we tested one of the most popular
binaries that can be compiled to Wasm with support to WASI: {\tt uutils
coreutils}, the porting of the coreutils in Rust~\cite{coreutils-repo}.
First, we compiled the coreutils with the {\tt wasm32-wasi}
target, and applied runtime-specific optimization
(with {\tt wasmedgec}~\cite{wasmedgec} for WasmEdge and with
{\tt wasmtime compile}~\cite{wasmtimecompile} for Wasmtime) to further
speed up the code. Then, we reproduced
the benchmarks reported in the coreutils repository, with the
exception of those that are not portable to WASI due to temporary lack
of support (e.g., the {\tt dd} utility needs to spawn threads, a
feature that is yet to be implemented~\cite{wasi-threads}). Finally, we
repeated the experiments with our protection in place. The Hyperfine
benchmarking tool~\cite{hyperfine} was used to log measures, and 1000
runs were performed (with 100 warmups). As shown from the results in Table~\ref{table:exp}, our approach introduces
a limited overhead, ranging from an additional 0.12\% to 6.30\% for
WasmEdge, and from 0.28\% to 14.29\% for Wasmtime. As expected, the
highest overhead is experienced by short-living utilities (e.g.,
{\tt head}). We also observe that there are notable differences
between the WasmEdge and Wasmtime test execution time for some utilities (e.g.,
{\tt ls} and {\tt cut}); from our analysis these differences are
mostly caused by the specific post-compilation optimizations.
