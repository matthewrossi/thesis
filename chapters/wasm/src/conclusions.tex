\section{Conclusions}

The results achieved by our approach are promising: not only it
permits to introduce fine-grained policies to restrict file system
access, it is also associated with a limited overhead which is aligned
with the needs of a modern sandbox. The protection is currently
applied only to the file system, but our approach has the potential to
be extended also to network sockets, which are in the first stage of
the standardization process~\cite{wasi-sockets}. We believe this
could be an interesting line of research for future work.
