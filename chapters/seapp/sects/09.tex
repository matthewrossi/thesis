\section{Conclusions}\label{sect:seapp_conclusions}

This chapter proposed an extension to the current MAC solution (\sel)
already available in Android.  Developers can use \sel to define
domains that are internal to their apps, in such a way that it is
possible to leverage the modules that are already providing protection
to the system.  By mapping SELinux domains to activities and services,
developers can limit the impact that a vulnerability has on the app
processes and files.  We described in the chapter the changes that we
introduced into Android, and our experimental evaluation shows that
the overhead introduced by our proposal is compatible with the
additional security guarantees.
